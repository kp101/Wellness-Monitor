The goal of this project is to implement a collection of IoT devices around the house for remote monitoring of seniors or  children returning from school. To that end, provide a low cost, customizable pathway for monitoring activities, alarms and alerts.

The strategy is to use MQTT as a central broker for monitoring. We are monitoring:
  1. the occupants' movement from room to room,
  2. the temperature, pressure, humidity of each room,
  3. alerting the hearing impaired inhabitant with blinking flasher if the doorbell message is receive,
  4. more to come...
