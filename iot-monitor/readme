This is a set of routines (client/server) to collect iot status as data point for monitoring over time. 

The IoT clients are tested for Raspberry Pi 2B/3B+/4B/Zero 2W. Others should work but not tested. 
  - The client shell script is in BASH syntax and can be place anywhere in user home directory. 
  - It should be scheduled via crontab -e on a periodic basis for execution. No root privileages are required.
  - The script will gather data points and do a 'http get' to report on the server of your choice. Please edit the script to replace the server address.

On the server side, the server stack is the node-red/influxdb3/grafana.  The iot-flows.json the flow in node-red for receiving the client data. 
It will make map it into the sensors table with fields/tags, change this to your own preference.
